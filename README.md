## 🗄️ Database Design

The project uses SQLite as the default database for development. The database design is based on Django models and includes relationships between users, artists, bookings, portfolios, and messages.

### Main Models

#### User

The `User` model extends Django's `AbstractUser` and adds:

- `role`: Identifies whether the user is a client or artist.
- `phone`: Stores the user's contact number.

Relationship:

- One user can create multiple bookings as a client.
- One artist user can have one artist profile.
- One user can send and receive many messages.

#### ArtistProfile

The `ArtistProfile` model stores artist-specific details:

- Bio, portfolio URL, location, style, base price, avatar, rating, booking count, availability, phone, experience, and mediums.

Relationship:

- One `ArtistProfile` belongs to one `User`.
- One `ArtistProfile` can have many portfolio images.
- One `ArtistProfile` can receive many bookings.

#### Portfolio

The `Portfolio` model stores artwork images uploaded by artists:

- Image, title, upload date, and artist reference.

Relationship:

- Many portfolio items belong to one artist profile.

#### Booking

The `Booking` model stores custom artwork requests:

- Client, artist, description, service type, artwork size, delivery type, delivery address, preferred date, reference image, status, total price, advance amount, payment status, payment screenshot, and timestamps.

Relationship:

- Many bookings can be created by one client.
- Many bookings can be assigned to one artist profile.

#### Message

The `Message` model stores conversations:

- Sender, receiver, text, attachment, attachment metadata, timestamp, and read status.

Relationship:

- Many messages can be sent and received by users.
- Conversations are built using sender and receiver relationships.
